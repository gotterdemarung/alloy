Coding standards
================

The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code 
from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and 
expectations about how to format PHP code.

The style rules herein are derived from commonalities among the various member
projects. When various authors collaborate across multiple projects, it helps
to have one set of guidelines to be used among all those projects. Thus, the
benefit of this guide is not in the rules themselves, but in the sharing of
those rules.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].
